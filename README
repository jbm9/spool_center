spool_center
============

This is a set of decorative spool holder hubs.

In general, you can use it to make decorative hubs of any
size for any purpose.  Moire patterns are great space-filling
curves


(This is an undertaker project.  Undertaker is a tool for managing the 
open source development/publishing/release process, which pulls your 
source code, documentation, blog posts, etc, all into a single static 
"gitball" for release.  It can also generate static websites from 
locally-dynamic files, allowing you to have a project blog that looks
dynamic but is actually statically published.  This makes your content
very friendly to archiving by tools like the wayback machine, and also
to indexing by web crawlers.  You can also publish all your content via
trivial static webservers, including CDNs or just local files.
