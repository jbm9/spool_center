<h1>Moire-pattern Spool Centers</h1>

<p>I needed hubs to hold the spool for my 3d printer filament.  Since I had a 3d printer, the natural next step was to print some up.  Since I had OpenSCAD, the natural next step is to design my own.  Since I had a math degree, the natural next step is to make pretty patterns.  Since I had years of software engineering, the next step was to shave the Moire pattern yak.</p>

<p>Once I recovered from all that, I wound up with some pretty neat-looking spool hubs.</p>
